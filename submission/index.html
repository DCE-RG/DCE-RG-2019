			<h1>Poster Submission</h1>
			
			<p>The workshop is looking for contributed posters on all aspects of Stein's method, including foundational work and/or its application to any topic relating to machine learning or statistics. Submissions can either be about novel work, or be based on recently published papers. We particularly welcome submissions which aim to spark discussions on novel uses of Stein's method in machine learning, statistics and related topics.</p>

<p>To contribute to the workshop, please send a half-page abstract in pdf form to steinworkshop@gmail.com. The submissions will then be reviewed by a panel consisting of the organisers of the workshop, and be accepted based on their relevance to the workshop as highlighted above. </p>

<p>This workshop is aiming to be inclusive, and we therefore particularly encourage submissions from under-represented communities.</p>

<p>Note that four complimentary workshop registrations are available. Please indicate whether you would like to be considered for these when submitting your proposal. </p>

<p>Deadline for submissions: TBC</p>

<p>Accepted posters: TBC </p>
