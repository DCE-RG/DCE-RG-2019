<div class="blurb">
	<p>Stein's method is a technique from probability theory for bounding the distance between probability measures using differential and difference operators. 
Although the method was initially designed as a technique for proving central limit theorems, it has recently caught the attention of the machine learning (ML) community and has been used for a variety of practical tasks. 
Recent applications include goodness-of-fit testing, generative modeling, global non-convex optimisation, variational inference, de novo sampling, constructing powerful control variates for Monte Carlo variance reduction, and measuring the quality of (approximate) Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms.  



<p>Although Stein's method has already had significant impact in ML, most of the applications only scratch the surface of this rich area of research in probability theory. 
There would be significant gains to be made by encouraging both communities to interact directly, and this inaugural workshop is an attempt to achieve that.</p>
